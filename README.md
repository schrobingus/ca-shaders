# Cellular Automata Shaders

This summer, I decided to learn how to create GLSL shaders. The following repository is a collection of implementations of cellular automata I have made this summer, that run using WebGL.

For now, there are only Shadertoy implementations (under the named directory), however, I do plan on rewriting these to work using just WebGL and JavaScript in a separate directory.

[My Shadertoy profile can be viewed here,](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/schrobingus), although I only make my shaders public on there if they are complete.
